Before retiring they did some quick counting and found that the fruits were less than a hundred in number. During the night one boy oke, counted the mangoes and found that he could divide the mangoes into three equal parts if he first took one for himself. He then took one mango, ate it up, and took 1/3 of the rest hid them separately and went back to sleep. Shortly thereafter anotheboy awoke, counted the mangoes and he again found that if he took one for himself the loot could be divided into three equal parts. He ate up one mango, bagged 1/3 of the remainder, hid them separately and went back to sleep. The third boy also awoke after some time, did the same and went back to sleep. In the morning when they l woke up, and counted their mangoes, they found that the remaining mangoes again totalled 1 more than could be .divided into three equal parts. How many mangoes did the  hs steal?

ly loved more than baking was eating. So during the night, Papa got up and ate 1/3 of the pastries. He thought the dog looked hungry so he gave 1 pastry to it. Ed was the next to give up. He planned to eat 1/4 of the pastries, but when he separated them into 4 piles, he found there were 3 pastries left over. He fed those 3 to the dog and ate 1/4 of the remaining pastries. Lisa then got up and ate 1/3 of the remaining pastries. When heading back to bed the dog cried so she fed him 2 pastries. Judy was the last to get up, and she consumed 8 pastries but then gave 1/8 of those remaining to her dog. When mama went into the kitchen the next morning, she found crumbs, aunts and only 14 pastries. She ate 2 pastries, gave 2 to her dog, and then split the remaining pastries evenly for her whole family, including herself to have for breakfast. How many pastries did the family bake, and how many pastries did each person consume?
