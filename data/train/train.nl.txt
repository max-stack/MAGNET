Before retiring they did some quick counting and found that the fruits were less than a hundred in number. During the night one boy oke, counted the mangoes and found that he could divide the mangoes into three equal parts if he first took one for himself. He then took one mango, ate it up, and took 1/3 of the rest hid them separately and went back to sleep. Shortly thereafter anotheboy awoke, counted the mangoes and he again found that if he took one for himself the loot could be divided into three equal parts. He ate up one mango, bagged 1/3 of the remainder, hid them separately and went back to sleep. The third boy also awoke after some time, did the same and went back to sleep. In the morning when they l woke up, and counted their mangoes, they found that the remaining mangoes again totalled 1 more than could be .divided into three equal parts. How many mangoes did the  hs steal?
